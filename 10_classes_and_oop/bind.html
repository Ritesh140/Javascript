/*

In JavaScript, the bind() method is used to explicitly set the this value inside a function, no matter how or where that function is called. It's particularly useful in situations where the context of this might change, like event handling or callback functions.

What is this in JavaScript?
this refers to the context in which a function is invoked. Its value depends on how and where the function is called.
In the global context, this refers to the global object (window in browsers).
Inside a class or object method, this usually refers to the object or class instance.
